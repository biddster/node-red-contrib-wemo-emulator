# node-red-contrib-wemo-emulator

**NOTE** if you're upgrading from a version prior to 1.0.0, it is recommended that you get Alexa to forget all devices and rediscover. This is due to the fix to prevent duplicated wemo-emulator devices appearing in the Alexa app.

Why might you want to emulate Wemo? Well I wanted to be able to control my Node-RED Raspberry Pi using my Amazon Echo. The
Echo has Wemo support built in so I thought I'd give it a try.

It's pretty cool to be able to say 'Alexa, turn my garden watering system on' and my Pi turns on the outdoor watering system.

This Node-RED node is only a slim wrapper around the marvellous [wemore](https://github.com/dhleong/wemore) Wemo library written by Daniel Leong.

### Installation

Change directory to your node red installation:

    $ npm install node-red-contrib-wemo-emulator

### Configuration

Drag the node on to your workspace, configure it as below and then ask Alexa to discover devices.

| Config          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Node Name`     | This is the name of the node as it appears in the Node-RED workspace                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Friendly Name` | This is the name that you'll see in the list of devices known to Alexa, it's also the name that you use in voice commands                                                                                                 |
| `Unique ID`     | This ID should be unique across all the wemo-emulator nodes in your workspace                                                                                                                                             |
| `Port`          | Wemore can automatically select a port to listen on, but it is recommended that you enter a unique port and increment it for each wemo emulator node you add to your workspace. This ensures that the port never changes. |
| `On Topic`      | This is the topic sent when you ask Alexa to turn your thing on                                                                                                                                                           |
| `On Payload`    | This is the payload sent when you ask Alexa to turn your thing on                                                                                                                                                         |
| `Off Topic`     | This is the topic sent when you ask Alexa to turn your thing off                                                                                                                                                          |
| `Off Payload`   | This is the payload sent when you ask Alexa to turn your thing off                                                                                                                                                        |

### Troubleshooting

If Alexa can't discover the devices emulated by this node, please check you don't have a firewall blocking the following ports:

-   1900/udp
-   You must also open the ports for all of the wemo emulator nodes configured

Alexa searches for devices using SSDP, this means that if your node-red installation is inside a Docker container you need to be careful around configuration in order to make the node "discoverable".  One way to do this is to configure the container to be in network_mode: "host", this allows it direct access to the ports of the device that is hosting it and makes it discoverable (although this takes it off of bridge networks within docker so communication with the other containers needs to be via localhost etc).

### Enabling extra debugging

Install `node-red-contrib-config` and drag a config node into your workspace. Configure the node to set a global variable called `wemo-emulator`
with a JSON value of `{"debug": true}`. Also make sure that the config tickbox for `active` is unchecked. Redeploy. Now click the button on the config node.
This will trigger all instances of `wemo-emulator` to write extra logging to the os syslog next time they're invoked.

### Experimental

The node-red `msg` object now contains a sender object which attempts to identify the echo which was spoken to. This is still under scrutiny and may or may not work for you.
